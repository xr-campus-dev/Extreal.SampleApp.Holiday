- This application uses Vivox for voice and text chat. Create an account on [Vivox Developer Portal](https://developer.vivox.com/) and create an application to connect to from this application.
- Clone the repository.
- Before opening in the Unity Editor, Create the following class in the `Assets/Holiday/App/AssetWorkflow/Custom` directory.

  ```csharp
  namespace Extreal.SampleApp.Holiday.App.AssetWorkflow.Custom
  {
      public static class SecretVariables
      {
          public static string ServerAddress => "test";
          public static string CryptAssetIv => "initialization-vector";
          public static string CryptAssetPassword => "password";
      }
  }
  ```

- Open the cloned directory in the Unity editor.
    - If "Link your Unity project" appears, close it without setting it.
